<pre>Afferent, the city bus cramps to the curb and brakes</pre>
<pre>through</pre>
<pre>Solipsistic muteness</pre>
<pre>With an exhaltation startled and choking.</pre>
<pre>As the sun blazes upon the terminal's</pre>
<pre>Scraped concrete</pre>
<pre>The shelved rows of the poor men</pre>
<pre>Hear the sound die on the pavement</pre>
<pre>In a gradual dying echo.</pre>
<pre>A cigarette succumbs to the voice as</pre>
<pre>Carrion brought to life; all the tattered people</pre>
<pre>awaken;</pre>
<pre>And a man spits toward the tire of the bus,</pre>
<pre>But misses.</pre>
<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>And as he watches his own spit vanish</pre>
<pre>From the hard crest of the world,</pre>
<pre>And silently scrapes his lunch pail against</pre>
<pre>A corner of a metallic bench as if expecting the pale</pre>
<pre>to bleed...</pre>
<pre>And hoping it would bleed...he tries to remember the</pre>
<pre>angles</pre>
<pre>He and his wife stood to project</pre>
<pre>The intermingled shadows that both</pre>
<pre>Had labeled as their marriage.</pre>
<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>He enters the second bus:</pre>
<pre>Its coolness sedating the skin that</pre>
<pre>Overlaps his troubled mind.</pre>
<pre>His thoughts pull together</pre>
<pre>Like the light, cool flow of the air conditioning.</pre>
<pre>He feels a little pacified.</pre>
<pre>He knows the shadow's intangible depth:</pre>
<pre>Its vastness having overpowered him these months</pre>
<pre>Until he could not reach the logic that told him</pre>
<pre>To find himself outside its barriers.</pre>
<pre>As he stares out of the window</pre>
<pre>He wonders why she has left.</pre>
<pre>How could she have left without indication</pre>
<pre>When he has remained angled toward work</pre>
<pre>So that he and his wife can stay alive?</pre>
<pre>In the bus window he sees his diaphanous face--the</pre>
<pre>windows</pre>
<pre>Of the Hilton, where he has a job in maintenance,</pre>
<pre>Piercing solidly through its head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He rings the bell.</pre>
<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>The idea of her not home, and legally annulled</pre>
<pre>From his life--her small crotch not tightened to his</pre>
<pre>desperate</pre>
<pre>Thrusts--makes him feel sick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He gets down from the</pre>

<pre>I use her earth to plant my seed--</pre>

<pre>And then, planted and repulsed,</pre>
<pre>Only the seam of backbone minutely faces her,</pre>

<pre>With all conscious force</pre>
<pre>I breathe the aloneness that intangibly defines the</pre>
<pre>Air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I swallow its ambrosia</pre>

<pre>Why I ever married the woman.</pre>

<pre>Lost, I drink my coffee alone on the stoop.</pre>

<pre>I drink me in when I am not</pre>
<pre>Pressed by the coffee's steam.</pre>
<pre>Cars' casketed phantoms of people</pre>
<pre>Chasing up and down Dunlavy Street of Houston</pre>
<pre>After something--their whole lives after something--</pre>
<pre>Come and go from consciousness like respiration.</pre>
<pre>The people plant and reap.</pre>
<pre>Who can count all of their</pre>

<pre>The reappearance of their light enamored us, and we</pre>
<pre>left</pre>

<pre>In Houston's summers the gods</pre>

<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>A mile from the bayou</pre>
<pre>The settled imagination of a</pre>
<pre>Nine year-old Vietnamese girl</pre>
<pre>Allows a mangled brown horse</pre>
<pre>To elongate and flatten out</pre>
<pre>To the reality of the rolled up carpet</pre>
<pre>(All because of the rain).</pre>
<pre>She feels the wetness now beginning</pre>
<pre>To seep into her clothes;</pre>
<pre>She raises herself; she sees the old Cuban</pre>
<pre>Walking from the house with hands</pre>
<pre>To the sky, as if to make the heavens appear a little</pre>
<pre>longer</pre>
<pre>In the manner that the downtown buildings,</pre>
<pre>From Dallas Street on, by their</pre>
<pre>Stories of windows draw down</pre>
<pre>the sky's enormity from measurement</pre>
<pre>Both extensive and inadequate;</pre>
<pre>And she follows him.</pre>
<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>Apart</pre>
<pre>And yet they both think about the Vietnamese</pre>
<pre>Teenager with curlers in her hair</pre>
<pre>Who yells &quot;boo&quot; behind doors</pre>
<pre>That are entered;</pre>
<pre>The Cambodian boy who</pre>
<pre>To the view of the Montrose area</pre>
<pre>Pours on the bare shrubs,</pre>
<pre>And then strips and pours upon himself,</pre>
<pre>The water from a hose, and that both animal and plant</pre>
<pre>Glisten in the sun</pre>
<pre>As if they have been greased;</pre>
<pre>Falling into Houston's world of high buildings</pre>
<pre>From the descending planes</pre>
<pre>While hoping that the big world would</pre>
<pre>Not overpower their memories;</pre>
<pre>And the Cubans, in house #2 always yelling of &quot;Miami.&quot;</pre>
<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>They believe that Cambodian refugees</pre>
<pre>Always clean house #1,</pre>
<pre>That Africans never clean themselves,</pre>
<pre>and that Laotians often pour rice down the drains</pre>
<pre>Causing the faucets of the house to stop-up;</pre>
<pre>And that the welcome-center Manager</pre>
<pre>Does not care to bring over a little clothing</pre>
<pre>And a little food or take them on little trips</pre>
<pre>To the Social Security Office or the doctor's office</pre>
<pre>Past 5 p.m.--</pre>
<pre>But of different seconds in that minute,</pre>
<pre>Different lengths, and various perceptions.</pre>
<pre>She remembers the ugly man</pre>
<pre>In Vietnam that ran from the police</pre>
<pre>And then a scar around his eye</pre>
<pre>Opened from the clubs and the blood</pre>
<pre>Tried to escape him completely</pre>
<pre>As the body attempted to pull itself</pre>
<pre>From the street, and could not.</pre>
<pre>He remembers thinking that the</pre>
<pre>Cranium of an old man is always heavy</pre>
<pre>On the neck, and that his</pre>
<pre>Is becoming like this.</pre>
<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>He desires to clasp the gate</pre>
<pre>That is around the Hispanic cemetery</pre>
<pre>And watches the cars on Allen Parkway, below,</pre>
<pre>Curve and toward the sun</pre>
<pre>Become a gleam moving endlessly</pre>
<pre>And instantly gone.</pre>
<pre>He desires to arrive there and</pre>
<pre>Read a few tombstones</pre>
<pre>Before and after watching.</pre>
<pre>She desires to imagine horses</pre>
<pre>Carrying her away from here to the West,</pre>
<pre>And other horses following with her family behind.</pre>
<pre>She desires to follow the Cuban that she fears</pre>
<pre>Since he is moving away from the refugee houses.</pre>
<pre>There are no horses in inner-city; and</pre>
<pre>The Hispanic cemetery cannot be found</pre>
<pre>To souls wanting to rest there.</pre>
<pre>&quot;Este cerca de calle Alabama?&quot;</pre>
<pre>He wonders,.</pre>
<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>The rain stops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The hammers and saws</pre>
<pre>peel their sounds from a roof.</pre>
<pre>And he notices her steps</pre>
<pre>Despite the stronger sounds; halts;</pre>
<pre>And glances behind him as shingles fall ahead,</pre>
<pre>While wanting her to completely leave him</pre>
<pre>And wanting her to come with him.</pre>
<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>In Houston's summers,</pre>
<pre>At certain areas, shingles like</pre>
<pre>The god's shit falls from housetops</pre>
<pre>And the dung dries in the air,</pre>
<pre>Flattens, and ricochets to sidewalks.</pre>
<pre>In Houston Cubans pack</pre>
<pre>From refugee houses</pre>
<pre>And plan to fly away into America, and depart</pre>
<pre>Far from the Castilian hot-dog vender</pre>
<pre>Of Herman Park waiting for</pre>
<pre>The thirsty and hungered</pre>
<pre>And those ignorant of what they want</pre>
<pre>But know that they want something</pre>
<pre>And so come to buy from her</pre>
<pre>Who wants people to come to her</pre>
<pre>For more than the chips</pre>
<pre>Because the hotdogs are overpriced,</pre>
<pre>Who formulates</pre>
<pre>That she is unskilled</pre>
<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>And that a computer course would answer it all;</pre>
<pre>Far from the Netherland psychologists who</pre>
<pre>Stares at her ebony reflection</pre>
<pre>In Rothko Chapel's dyed pool;</pre>
<pre>Apart from others, and no-one, all</pre>
<pre>Pulling alone for humanity to both</pre>

<pre>Saturday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All the same:</pre>
<pre>A silvery grey</pre>

<pre>In exact shadow; and he finds his car.</pre>
<pre>The lid, laced in rust,</pre>

<pre>Parts the grey as it pulls up;</pre>
<pre>The grocery bag is dropped into the hole;</pre>
<pre>And the ground beef slaps down on the floor</pre>

<pre>Its grounded nerves convulsing it</pre>
<pre>A couple of inches nearer the oil stain.</pre>
<pre>That meat, in body, that last moment</pre>
<pre>After consciousness has severed itself;</pre>
<pre>Skin peeling under the fur, hidden,</pre>
<pre>But not from the last hot beams ahead</pre>
<pre>Of emerging dusk, becoming crisp</pre>
<pre>And then soaking up the hot blood, as the trachea,</pre>
<pre>With the last of the air drawing in,</pre>
<pre>begins to fold its walls; and he could imagine it</pre>
<pre>Like he could imagine, from unexact memories,</pre>
<pre>The woman, last night</pre>
<pre>At the hospital, whom he began to like--</pre>
<pre>her body pulling cell by cell</pre>
<pre>Apart before he had a chance</pre>
<pre>To finish the rescue with the hose</pre>
<pre><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>Descending the nostril as a rope,</pre>

<pre>With its facial tip of the nose and its greased</pre>
<pre>Separation of hair like a wet muskrat in a metallic</pre>
<pre>reflection.</pre>
<pre>His face moving away, he sees an old Hispanic man</pre>
<pre>Who walks from the area of cars carrying two bags</pre>
<pre>Of groceries in an embrace that could be</pre>
<pre>For weighty children; he thinks &quot;The senescent,</pre>
<pre>Carless, careless baws--turd!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A campesino!,&quot;</pre>
<pre>And he envisions himself as that: having to pull out</pre>
<pre>the thorns</pre>
<pre>That pierce through his tennis shoes as he shovels</pre>
<pre>scattered cacti leaves from out of the back</pre>
<pre>Of the pickup to his animals;</pre>
<pre>And living in the dry ravine surrounded by houses made</pre>
<pre>of wood</pre>

<pre>beside</pre>
<pre>The families of the kiln workers</pre>
<pre>Who with him eat out Land's blessings</pre>

<pre>like a child lying on the sofa in fever and hoping</pre>
<pre>That in the shadows on the wall and the</pre>

<pre>One will bring deliverance--only placing the</pre>
<pre>deliverance</pre>
<pre>On him and yet loving him for himself</pre>
<pre>Beyond that need. And while unlocking the door of his</pre>
<pre>car</pre>
<pre>He feels that the recreation in life is also a</pre>
<pre>routine:</pre>
<pre>A routine of sharing and parting,</pre>
<pre>And at the end one is grounded and tossed</pre>

<pre>Gabriele, held together by the stitching of hate--</pre>

<pre>This time it will be you who shall feel the wall of</pre>

<pre>Your house was hot and your oven smelled of baking</pre>
<pre>meatloaf</pre>
<pre>Although you had said that you could not be</pre>
<pre>domesticated.</pre>
<pre>And then I saw your bottle of wine</pre>
<pre>Standing at attention before two glasses.</pre>
<pre>The pledge that bowing to anything or anyone was</pre>
<pre>wrong...that people</pre>
<pre>Were only needed to gain the most bare</pre>
<pre>Of physiological and psychological needs (pitstops to</pre>
<pre>being</pre>
<pre>human)--this was</pre>
<pre>gone.</pre>
<pre>Gone with your hair brushed and your skin smelling of</pre>

<pre>Come on Gabriele, the gal that used to chew tobacco</pre>
<pre>and</pre>
<pre>Spit it into an empty beer can...</pre>
<pre>The gal with the deep dark-ocean eyes...</pre>
<pre>The maddog gal, grip that wine glass now.</pre>
<pre>For Gabriele, you smile at everyone with meaning</pre>
<pre>You are as together as a feather when a hurricane is</pre>
<pre>in town,</pre>
<pre>And when the hangover's over and your own insight has</pre>
<pre>Fragmented you from a million pieces to a billion,</pre>
<pre>My stiff polar bear arms</pre>
<pre>Shall poke and not embrace.</pre>

<pre>You all are the performers this time...</pre>
<pre>And Gabriele, you are the main attraction,</pre>
<pre>Attracted, after this night, to the omni-present sense</pre>
<pre>of your</pre>
<pre>Smashed self; and me--</pre>
<pre>Sensitive little me in no man's land</pre>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
